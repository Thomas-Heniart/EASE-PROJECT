[About the creators](#12-about-the-creators)\n\n\n\n## 1. What is NativeBase?\n[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is a sleek, ingenious and dynamic front-end framework created by passionate React Loving team at [Geekyants.com](https://geekyants.com/) to build cross platform Android & iOS mobile apps using ready to use generic components of React Native.\n\n\n\n## 2. Why NativeBase?\nWhat is really great with [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is that you can use shared UI cross-platform components, which will drastically increase your productivity. When using NativeBase, you can use any native third-party libraries out of the box.<br />\n\n**Recommended by** *Microsoft*\n> If you're looking to get started with React Native + CodePush, and are looking for an awesome starter kit, you should check out Native Starter Pro - [Microsoft's react-native-code-push repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#example-apps--starters)\n\n**Recommended by [Awesome React Native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native)**\n>NativeBase added into the list of [Frameworks](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native#frameworks) of Awesome React Native and are also used by many other React lovers across the world.\n\n\n## 4. Getting Started\n\n**a. Setup with pure React Native app**\n\n*Install NativeBase*\n\n```js\nnpm install native-base --save\n```\n*Install Peer Dependencies*<br />\nThe peer dependencies included from any npm packages does not automatically get installed. Your application will not depend on it explicitly.\n\n```js\nreact-native link\n```\n\nYou've successfully setup [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) with your [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app. Your React Native app is now all set to run on iOS and Android simulator.\n\n\n**b. Setup with CRNA**\n\n*Create React Native project using the CRNA cli.* <br />\nCRNA helps you make React Native apps with no build configuration. Create React App works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. <br />\nRefer this link for additional information [CRNA](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)\n\n*Install NativeBase*\n```js\nnpm install native-base --save\n```\n*Install @expo/vector-icons*\n```js\nnpm install @expo/vector-icons --save\n```\n<br />\n\n**Note** <br />\n[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) uses some custom fonts that can be loaded using **loadAsync** function. Check out [this](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v15.0.0/sdk/font.html#expofontloadasyncname-url) expo link.\n<br />\nSyntax <br />\n```js\nasync componentWillMount() {\n      await Expo.Font.loadAsync({\n        'Roboto': require('native-base/Fonts/Roboto.ttf'),\n        'Roboto_medium': require('native-base/Fonts/Roboto_medium.ttf'),\n        'Ionicons': require('@expo/vector-icons/fonts/Ionicons.ttf'),\n      });\n```\n<br />\n\nCheck out the [KitchenSink](https://expo.io/@geekyants/nativebasekitchensink) with CRNA for an example of the implementation.<br />\nFind the [KitchenSink repo here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink/tree/CRNA)\n\n## 5. Components\n\n[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is made from effective building blocks referred to as components. The Components are constructed in pure [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) platform along with some JavaScript functionality with rich set of customisable properties. These components allow you to quickly build the perfect interface.\n\n## 6. Compatibility Versions\n\n| NativeBase   |      React Native      |\n|----------|-------------|\n| v0.1.1\t| v0.22 to v0.23 |\n| v0.2.0 to v0.3.1 | v0.24 to v0.25 |\n| v0.4.6 to v0.4.9 | v0.26.0 - v0.27.1 |\n| v0.5.0 to v0.5.15 | v0.26.0 - v0.37.0 |\n| v0.5.16 to v0.5.20 | v0.38.0 - v0.39.0 |\n| v2.0.0-alpha1 to v2.1.3 | v0.38.0 to v0.43.0 |\n| v2.1.4 to v2.1.5 | v0.44.0 to v0.45.0 |\n| v2.2.0 | v0.44.0 to v0.45.0 |\n| v2.2.1 | v0.46.0 and above |\n| v2.3.0 | v0.46.0 and above *(does not support React 16.0.0-alpha.13)*|\n\n## 7. [Native Starter Kit](https://github.com/start-react/native-starter-kit) Deprecated\n\nA simple starter project for [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) + [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) + [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) + [CodePush](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push) + [React Native Navigator](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html) apps on iOS and Android.\n[Take a look at the demo](https://github.com/start-react/native-starter-kit#screens)\n\n\n## 8.
