security.masterKey.title=Your master password
security.masterKey.tip1=You are the only<br>person knowing it
security.masterKey.tip2=It is the security key<br>of your other<br>passwords
security.masterKey.tip3=Only you can<br>access your data
security.funcs.tip1.title=How it works
security.funcs.tip1.text=Your information are confidential. The IDs and passwords you store on Ease.space are secured thanks to your master password. You are the only person knowing it and Ease.space will never have access to it.
security.funcs.tip2.title=Master password
security.funcs.tip2.text=We recommend you to make a strong password with at least 8 characters, inluding lower and upper letters and numbers. This password becomes the security key of your data. It is hashed, which allows us to store it in an unreadable manner on our servers in order to make no one able to read it.
security.funcs.tip3.title=Securization of your passwords
security.funcs.tip3.text=Our algorythm encrypts, thanks to your master password, all the information you will store on Ease.space. This means the passwords your store depend on this key, which make them unreadable without it. The result is that only you, being connected on Ease.space, can access your passwords.
security.funcs.tip4.title=Our technologies
security.funcs.tip4.text=We <u>hash</u> your master password thanks to a technology called Bcrypt, one of the leaders in password hashing. We add a salt code in order to reinforce security.<br>The <u>encryption</u> methode of the passwords stored on Ease.space is AES 256-bit. This is an algorythme made for symetric encryption, one of the most secure of the market.
security.anonymity.title=Anonymity and confidentiality
security.anonymity.tip1=We have decided to implement a strong internal policy in order to bring the highest serenity to our customers.  The data of our users remain confidential and are not used commercially.
security.anonymity.tip2=Our servers are hosted in France, in one of the leaders of Cloud computing, in order to assure the respect of European Union.
security.anonymity.tip3=Our team is not able to access your data, except the email address and user name you sent during your registration.
security.faq.title=What happens if...
security.faq.tip1.title=If a hacker tries to find my Ease.space password ?
security.faq.tip1.text=We encourage you to create a strong password. By choosing at least 8 characters with digits, upper and lower cases, it will create 280k billion possible combinations of passwords. Therefore, it would take a hacker tens of thousands of years to find the right password (trying 1 million combinations everyday, more or less 750 thousand years). To increase security, we even block the access for a couple of minutes after 10 wrong passwords.
security.faq.tip2.title=If I am not on my personal computer ?
security.faq.tip2.text=Ease.space is available on any computer. You only need to access https://ease.space and enter your login and password to access your accounts. Any computer can become your computer.
security.faq.tip3.title=If my computer gets stolen ?
security.faq.tip3.text=No data is stored on your computer. Only you, with your Ease.space password can access your other accounts.
security.faq.tip4.title=If I loose my Ease.space password ?
security.faq.tip4.text=For security reasons, we do not store your master password anywhere as it is the one protecting your other passwords. If you loose it, and you re-initialize it, all the passwords you gave us will be lost and you will have to add them again to your space (like when you started with Ease.space at the beginning).
security.faq.tip5.title=If a hacker finds his way to one of Ease.space databases ?
security.faq.tip5.text=Data stored on Ease.space databases are encrypted. No-one other than you can access your personal data from the Ease.space databases. If a hacker can accesses the databases, he will only access unreadable information thanks to the encryption.
