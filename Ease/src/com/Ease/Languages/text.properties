security.anonymity.text1=We ease your life <strong>without knowing it</strong>.
security.anonymity.text2=There are <strong>only two information</strong> we know about you : your main email address and a nickname you choose.
security.anonymity.text3=Other data (credentials, passwords, etc.) are <strong>anonymized thanks to your Ease.space password</strong>, a password we don\u2019t know thanks to our security system <a href="#4" class="cc-active">(check it out in chapter 4)</a>.
security.anonymity.text4=<strong>We don\u2019t sell your data</strong>. This isn\u2019t aligned with our values. Also we have another revenue stream, helping companies organise, share and use their passwords to work more efficiently and securely.
security.yoursecurity.text1=We improve the security of your personal passwords in various ways.
security.yoursecurity.text2=Your passwords aren\u2019t stored on a computer anymore, but in the <strong>servers of one of the European leaders in cloud security solutions</strong>, In addition, a third party company specialized in server and infrastructure security, monitors our servers physically and digitally 24/7. This is an advantage if your computer breaks and an additional protection if it\u2019s security gets compromised.
security.yoursecurity.text3=Your passwords are stored <strong>encrypted 24/7</strong>. Your can delete your excel file and burn your post-it.
security.yoursecurity.text4=You are always <strong>up to date on the latest security technologies and practices</strong>.
security.yoursecurity.text5=<strong>We prevent potential frauds</strong> before they happen : when you fail to enter your Ease.space password 10 times in a row, we will block your account for 5 minutes.
security.yoursecurity.text6=Stay <strong>safe on computers you don\u2019t know</strong> : we disable automatic password memorisation on computers you don\u2019t own or trust by blocking the password memorisation popup on Chrome.
security.yoursecurity.text7=You can now choose <strong>complicated passwords</strong>, and even different ones for each accounts. We will remember and type them for you.
security.yoursecurity.text8=Thanks to the <strong>internationally recognized security algorithms</strong> we use (see our white paper below) :
security.yoursecurity.text8.first=the passwords you store on Ease.space can only be accessed by you thanks to your Ease.space password.
security.yoursecurity.text8.second=we have no way to know your Ease.space password.
security.yoursecurity.text9=Therefore, <strong>Ease.space works like a credit card</strong>. If you lose your Ease.space password, you\u2019ll have to enter again the passwords you previously added. Taking this big decision allowed us to go even further in securing and anonymizing your data.
security.companysecurity.text1=Set up the best and latest technologies and practices.
security.companysecurity.text2=<u>General principle</u> : with our system, employees <strong>have access to an account without having to know the password</strong>. Not knowing the password means, not being able to write it on a post-it or share it in an email.
security.companysecurity.text3=<strong>Get a better control over who is using company web accounts</strong> : Thanks to the Team Space, share the right tools to the right people in a few clicks.
security.companysecurity.text4=Like in the Personal Space, you can <strong>turn off password memorization popup</strong> on unknown devices to make sure company passwords aren\u2019t stored on unknown devices. It is safer when people work remotely.
security.companysecurity.text5=<strong>For companies with interns</strong>, it is possible to share a password to a team member for a limited time, and program the automatic removal of someone\u2019s accesses the day they leave.
security.companysecurity.text6=We help <strong>implementing and maintaining password modification policies</strong> on the tools your company uses. The IT team can choose that passwords will be changed on a specific tool every 1, 3, 6 or 12 months.
security.companysecurity.text7=<strong>Sending passwords to (& between) teammates</strong> is secured, controlled and yet easy. The transfer from the sender to the receiver is encrypted twice : with our own security system, and HTTPS. Also, teammates can only share accounts inside the team they are in.
security.companysecurity.text8=<strong>Controlling the renewal of the Ease.space password</strong> becomes important. When a teammate\u2019s password is lost and changed, the team admin needs to confirm that the member can come back in the team (and have access to the accounts again). This gives the admin the time to make sure the password was really lost.
security.companysecurity.text9=In the case of a <strong>password lost by an admin</strong>, our team will contact him or her directly by phone to make sure the password renewal is genuine.
security.companysecurity.text10=To prevent some types of attacks, typing 10 times a wrong password trying to login to an account will <strong>block it for 5 minutes</strong>.
security.companysecurity.text11=To know more, <a href="/resources/documents/Ease.space_Security-Whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">read our Security White Paper</a>
security.oursecurity.text1=This part is detailed in our <a href="/resources/documents/Ease.space_Security-Whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">Security White Paper</a>.
security.oursecurity.text2=<strong>How do we secure the passwords of the accounts you have ?</strong>
security.oursecurity.text3=When you connect to a website, we need to send the password to your computer in a way that <strong>only you can receive it</strong>. We do that with asymmetrical encryption. Encrypting a password this way creates <strong>2 keys. One is private</strong> (only known to you), it can only decrypt the password. <strong>One is public</strong> (know to you and us), it can only encrypt the password. So, we encrypt your password with your public key, then you decrypt it using your private key so you can connect.
security.oursecurity.text4=We protect each private keys by encrypting them once more symmetrically. Symmetric encryption creates <strong>1 key</strong> (that can encrypt and decrypt). <strong>Thanks to that new key, we ensure the security of your private keys</strong>.
security.oursecurity.text5=<strong>After that, we make sure only you have access to this key</strong>, It is your Ease.space password that serves as the only key to lock and unlock it. So, when you login to Ease.space in the morning, the first key (your Ease.space password) decrypts a second key that decrypt a third key, that decrypts the passwords you need.
security.oursecurity.text6=<strong>How do we secure your Ease.space password ?</strong>
security.oursecurity.text7=We created a system where <strong>we don\u2019t know your Ease.space password</strong>. This is possible thanks to \u0022Hash\u0022, an <strong>internationally recognized and widely used security algorithm</strong>.
security.oursecurity.text8=<u>How do we know it is you if we don\u2019t know your password ?</u>
security.oursecurity.text9=Hashing a password is different than encrypting it.  Hashing and encrypting can be seen as mathematical functions that transforms a password into something unreadable. In the case of Hashing, there are no keys created, this means that from the unreadable word, there is no way (no key) to come back to the password.
security.oursecurity.text10=When you create an account on Ease.space, you enter your Ease.space password for the first time, we hash it and store the hash in our database. When you come back the next day and enter your password again to login, we hash it again, and compare the hash from your subscription and the hash from your connection. If the two hash are the same, we know it\u2019s really you while not knowing your password.
security.oursecurity.text11=In order to increase the security even more, we add what is called a \u0022salt\u0022. A salt is a chain of random letters we add to the password to make it more complex before hashing it.
security.oursecurity.text12=HTTPS allows 2 things : Encrypting data during the transfer, verify the authenticity of the sender and the receiver.
security.oursecurity.text13=<u>Encrypting</u> : Communications between a user and our servers are secured using HTTPS - SSL/TLS. We chose the Let\u2019s Encrypt Certificate. This disables the possibility of information being caught on the way.
security.oursecurity.text14=<u>Authentication</u> : This means that the right computer is exchanging data with the right server and that the server can be trusted.
security.oursecurity.text15=<strong>Servers</strong>
security.oursecurity.text16=All the traffic going to our server goes through a firewall. This means that the traffic from an unknown origin is filtered and blocked regarding the policy we chose.
security.oursecurity.text17=Vulnerability tests are run daily. And a detailed internal penetration test is performed quarterly with Qualys (Qualys is a security company used by most Forbes Global 100 companies.) Other tests by third parties are done regularly. Our objective is to always be increasing their recurrence.
security.oursecurity.text18=Finally, we collect anonymized error reports and crash data from user activity to improve our system\u2019s quality and security.
security.oursecurity.text19=To know more, <a href="/resources/documents/Ease.space_Security-Whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">read our Security White Paper</a>
security.ourpolicy.text1=We use Ease.space to manage and share our internal tools and accesses.
security.ourpolicy.text2=We have a confidentiality agreement that every new member of our team has to sign before joining.
security.ourpolicy.text3=When a member leaves the team, all his or her accesses are deleted and the passwords he or she had access to, are changed.
security.ourpolicy.text4=We have a password modification policy in place on all company web tools.
security.ourpolicy.text5=Our servers are located in a European cloud security leader. In addition to that, we also have a third party company that is in charge of monitoring them 24/7.
security.faq.question1=<strong>If a hacker tries to find my Ease.space password ?</strong>
security.faq.text1=First of all, we block an account for 5 minutes after 10 failed attempts to connect to it.
security.faq.text2=Also, we created a system where internally, <strong>we don\u2019t know your Ease.space password</strong>. This is possible thanks to an <strong>internationally recognized and widely used security algorithm called \u0022Hash\u0022</strong>.
security.faq.text3=<u>How do we know it is you if we don\u2019t know your password ?</u>
security.faq.text4=Hashing a password is different than encrypting it.  Hashing and encrypting can be seen as a mathematical function that transforms a password into something unreadable. In the case of Hashing, there are no keys created, this means that from the unreadable word, there is no way (no key) to come back to the password.
security.faq.text5=When you create an account on Ease.space, you enter your Ease.space password for the first time, we hash it and store the hash in our database. When you come back the next day and enter your password again to login, we hash it again, and compare the hash from your subscription and the hash from your connection. If the two hash are the same, we know it\u2019s really you while not knowing your password.
security.faq.text6=Thanks to the internationally recognized encryption algorithms we use (see our white paper below on the subject) :
security.faq.text6.first=the passwords you store on Ease.space can only be accessed by you thanks to your Ease.space password.
security.faq.text6.second=we have no way to know your Ease.space password.
security.faq.text7=Finally, we advise our users to create a complicated password. One with at least 8 characters with a digit,  a lower and an upper case. This level of complexity in a password creates 280\u2019000 billions possible combinations.
security.faq.question2=<strong>If I want to access my passwords on a computer that isn\u2019t mine ?</strong>
security.faq.text8=Ease.space is a website. Thus, you can access your passwords from any computer that is connected to the internet.
security.faq.question3=<strong>If my computer gets stolen or lost ?</strong>
security.faq.text9=First of all, it is important to secure your computer with a password. In addition to that security, we disconnect every account at night just in case. So basically, you have now 1 password to type only once a day. Finally, thanks to our security system, none of your passwords are stored on your computer.
security.faq.question4=<strong>If I lose my Ease.space password ?</strong>
security.faq.text10=Because your Ease.space password should be the only way to unlock your other passwords, for security reasons, we do not keep any key (any way) to renew it.
security.faq.text11=This means that <strong>Ease.space works like a credit card</strong>. If you lose your Ease.space password, your account will be lost as well, you\u2019ll have to enter again the passwords you previously added. Taking this big decision allowed us to go even further in securing and anonymizing your data.
